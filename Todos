This document describes the major topic I wish to implemet within this project, and also a list of minor bugs and fixes to do.


Major Topics:
1) Update README with instructions to install. Also add command line options with help menus. Update regularily as features are added. (DONE)
1b) Add command line parsing. (Done)
2) Add examples of scenes with keywords. (This is based on EDX, but includes new keywords for added features). (Done)
2b) Change to singleton patterns for scenemanager, sceneparser and raytracer - (Aborted)
2c) Add better error handling (within file parser, as well as program itself)
2d) Add option to usage non multi-threaded rendering - for debug purposes mainly. (Done)
3) Add more primitive objects - Cyllinder etc. Add scenes dipicting those images.
3b) Space partitioning for better performecnce more advances technices. 
4) Shadows - support soft shadows
5) Support reflections and refractions. 
6) Support meshes
7) Space partitioning for better performecnce more advances technices. 
8) Add textures to all objects and primitives.
9) Support anti-aliasing
10) Depth of field
11) More shading - more on softshadow, glossy effects, subsurface scattering
12) Monte-Carlo
13) Lighing Models: Ray Traceing vs Monte-Carlo vs Path-tracing vs Photon mapping - and make them available to use interchangeably.
14) Allow GPU rendering. 
15) Support motion blur



TODOs:

- Add Wall and Wextra flags and fix all warnings. (DONE)
- Remove Unused Variables. (DONE)
- Add supported files format for result image. (DONE)
- Fix unknown command maxvertx (Done)
- Check General texture from primitives and meshes not working. (Done)
- Check valgrind Issues (Done - Problem with linking Freeimage (31 blocks) 
- Check meshes textures memory allocation and free. (DONE)
- Test all transformations on objects - (Done)

- Fix stupid readme at github.
- Fix texture on triangles not from model
- Comment code
- Fix mesh properties multiply operator when value is not given (default) 
- Stop recursion of light contribution is minor. 
- Fix textures when applying transformations. 
- Consider Normal transformation when adding normals to meshes. (Model.cpp)
- Interpolate normals in triangles. (Triangle.cpp)
- Make sure specular and diffuse lighting also work on transformed object
- Transform normals for mesh objects
- Insert bounding-box intersection op.
