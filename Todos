This document describes the major topic I wish to implemet within this project, and also a list of minor bugs and fixes to do.


Major Topics:
1) Update README with instructions to install. Also add command line options with help menus. Update regularily as features are added. (Done)
1b) Add command line parsing. (Done)
2) Add examples of scenes with keywords. (This is based on EDX, but includes new keywords for added features). (Done)
2b) Change to singleton patterns for scenemanager, sceneparser and raytracer - (Aborted)
2c) Add better error handling (within file parser, as well as program itself) (Postponed)
2d) Add option to usage non multi-threaded rendering - for debug purposes mainly. (Done)
3) Add more primitive objects - Cyllinder etc. Add scenes dipicting those images. (Done)
3b) Add bounding box for better performecnce (Done)
4) Shadows - support soft shadows (Done)
5) Support reflections and refractions. 
6) Support meshes (Done)
7) Space partitioning for better performecnce more advances technices (Done)
8) Add textures to all objects and primitives. (Done)
8b) add textures generation
9) Support anti-aliasing (Done)
10) Depth of field
11) More shading:
	a) more soft shadows. (Done)
	b) glossy effects and glossy reflections (Done)
	c) subsurface scattering
	d) motion blur
	e) normals interpolations for meshes and triangels (Done)
	f) BRDF
	g) refractive mediums lights attenuations
	h) refractive surfaces shadows handling 
12) Lighting Models: Ray Traceing vs Monte-Carlo vs Path-tracing vs Photon mapping - and make them available to use interchangeably.
13) Allow GPU rendering. 
14) Add Sky boxes and environment mapping (reflective and refractive) (Done)
15) Add CSG



TODOs:

- Add Wall and Wextra flags and fix all warnings. (Done)
- Remove Unused Variables. (Done)
- Add supported files format for result image. (Done)
- Fix unknown command maxvertx (Done)
- Check General texture from primitives and meshes not working. (Done)
- Check valgrind Issues (Done - Problem with linking Freeimage (31 blocks) 
- Check meshes textures memory allocation and free. (Done)
- Test all transformations on objects - (Done)
- Fix stupid readme at github (Done)
- Fix texture on triangles not from model (Done)
- Fix texture on a cone shorter than double (Done)
- Fix general texture on object (Done)
- Add the option to insert colors in RGB values instead of 0-1 in scenes. (Done)
- Test normal transformation when creating meshes of object (Done)
- Fix mesh properties multiply operator when value is not given (Done) 
- FIx the applyObjectProps idiom - also add Props and transforms to primitives in Object constructor. and change the "calc bounding box public shit" (Done)
- Make sure specular and diffuse lighting also work on transformed object (Done)
- Insert bounding-box intersection op (Done)
- fix stats (Done)
- Stop recursion of light contribution is minor (Done)


- CHange to object properties in sceneparser

- Move to unique ptrs
- Ipmlemnt const mechanisms 
- Fix Vertices in Mesh class - (Copy of Vertex)
- Add textures generation
- Fix folder structure and fix dependecy within scene to textures and models
- Fix consts shits
- Fix textures when applying transformations. 
- Fix todos!
- Interpolate normals in triangles. (Triangle.cpp)


- Consider adding more primitives : Torus, disc and more. 



version 6 notes:
- Fixed a bug where meshes textures were not removed
- Fixed a bug where meshes textures cannot be shared
- Fixed a bug where meshes where not cleaned propely. 
- Added normals mapping - and texture per mesh. 
- C++ inhancments:
	- moved to smart pointers
	- used move mechanisms
	- handled const and references

- improved const mechanisms and interfaces 
- Fixed bug when counting statistics. Also changed mechanism not to count anything if flag is off, to save expansive atomic locks. 
- Removed triangles multiple (and stupid) decleration. (FInally no longer edx compatible)
- fixed a bug for memory access violation when creating vertecies. 
- ran valgrind again on all scenes to make sure no memory violations of any kind (except the known FreeImage() issue)
