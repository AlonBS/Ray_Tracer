This document describes the major topic I wish to implemet within this project, and also a list of minor bugs and fixes to do.


Topics:
1) Update README with instructions to install. Also add command line options with help menus. Update regularily as features are added. 
2) Add examples of scenes with keywords. (This is based on EDX for the most part).
2b) Change to singleton patterns for scenemanager, and add argument parser
2c) Add better error handling 
3) Add more primitive objects - Cyllinder etc. Add scenes dipicting those images.
4) Shadows - support soft shadows
5) Support reflections and refractions. 
6) Support meshes
7) Space partitioning for better performecnce. Start with bounding boxs, and move to more advances technices. 
8) Add textures to all objects and primitives.
9) Support anti-aliasing
10) Depth of field
11) More shading - more on softshadow, glossy effects, subsurface scattering
12) Monte-Carlo
13) Lighing Models: Ray Traceing vs Monte-Carlo vs Path-tracing vs Photon mapping - and make them available to use interchangeably.



TODOs:

- Check meshes textures memory allocation and free. 
- Test all transformations on objects
- Make sure specular and diffuse lighting also work on transformed object
- Transform normals for mesh objects
- Insert bounding-box intersection op.
- Support refractions
- support bump-maps
